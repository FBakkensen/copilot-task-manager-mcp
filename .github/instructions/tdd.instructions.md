Use BDD for all implementations. Write tests first, then implement the code to pass the tests. Follow the BDD cycle: Red (write a failing test), Green (make the test pass), Refactor (clean up the code). Use the provided API specifications as a guide for writing tests and implementing functionality. Ensure that all tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases.
