Always refer to the documentation in the folder .aidocs/ for the implementation plan and the API specifications. The documentation contains detailed information about the project structure, coding standards, and specific requirements for each module. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure that your implementation aligns with the project's goals and standards.
Use BDD for all implementations. Write tests first, then implement the code to pass the tests. Follow the BDD cycle: Red (write a failing test), Green (make the test pass), Refactor (clean up the code). Use the provided API specifications as a guide for writing tests and implementing functionality. Ensure that all tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases.
